# Geographic ACO Implementation

## Overview
`geoaco.jl` implements a hybrid approach combining K-means geographic clustering with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This approach partitions the problem geographically before applying optimization algorithms.

## Usage

### Running All Implementations
```julia
# The script runs all three implementations sequentially
# Results show optimized routes for each approach
```

### Output Format
```
ðŸ“¦ Route Comparison per Bus (TSP vs ACO)

ðŸšŒ Bus 1:
  - TSP Route  : Depot â†’ Stop A â†’ Stop B â†’ Depot
    Distance   : 45.2 km
  - ACO Route  : Depot â†’ Stop B â†’ Stop A â†’ Depot
    Distance   : 42.1 km

ðŸ“Š Total TSP Distance: 234.7 km
ðŸ“Š Total ACO Distance: 218.3 km
```

## Visualization
The script includes plotting capabilities:
- Geographic scatter plot of clusters
- Color-coded cluster assignments
- Longitude vs Latitude visualization

## Performance Notes
- **Basic Clustering**: Fastest but basic solution quality
- **Advanced Clustering**: Better quality with ACO optimization
- **Balanced Clustering**: Best solution quality with load balancing

## Data Requirements
- `bus_stops_metadata.csv`: Bus stop data with coordinates
- `distance_matrix.csv`: Distance matrix between all stops

## Notes
- All implementations automatically handle depot inclusion in all clusters
- Geographic clustering reduces problem complexity
- ACO within clusters provides better optimization than simple TSP
- Cluster merging ensures balanced workload distribution
- The approach scales well for larger datasets
