## Algorithm Features

### Traditional Approaches
- **Geographic Intelligence**: K-means clustering based on coordinates

2. **Improves Driver Experience**
   - Routes are easier to follow and understand
   - Reduces confusion and navigation errors
   - More efficient for real-world driving conditions

3. **Cost Savings**
   - Shorter total distances
   - Reduced fuel consumption
   - Lower operational costs

4. **Better Customer Service**
   - More predictable arrival times
   - Improved route efficiency
   - Better resource utilization

## Performance Notes
